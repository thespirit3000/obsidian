# Act 4 leveling

1. Enter The Dried Lake.
2. Locate Voll, defeat him, and take _Deshret’s Banner_. Return to town via logout or Portal.
3. Open the mines using _Deshret’s Banner_ and enter The Mines (Level One).
4. Proceed through the area and enter The Mines (Level Two).
5. Locate _Deshret’s Spirit_ and release it.
6. Enter the Crystal Veins.
7. Locate the _Waypoint_, at the end of the area, and return to Highgate.
8. Speak to Tasuni to receive the Book of Skill reward. Speak to Oyun to receive the _Golem_ gem reward.
9. This is where we reccomend you go complete your first Labyrinth and Ascend.
10. Return to the Crystal Veins via the _Waypoint_.
11. The next steps may be completed in either order, based on preference. We prefer to do Kaom’s Dream first, however, as the boss is generally a little less dangerous at lower levels.
    - Enter Kaom’s Dream and proceed through the area until you reach Kaom’s Stronghold. Acquire the _Waypoint_ and continue onwards, until you reach the Caldera of the King. Defeat Kaom and pick up the _Eye of Fury_. Return to town via logout or Portal, then take the _Waypoint_ to the Crystal Veins.
    - Enter Daresso’s Dream and proceed through the area until you encounter Barkhul. Defeat him and his bodyguards, then enter The Grand Arena and acquire the _Waypoint_. Proceed through the arenas until you encounter “The Trio”, a group of three unique enemies. This means that Daresso is in the next area, and signals you are on the correct path. Defeat the Trio and enter The Ring of Blades. Defeat Daresso and take the _Eye of Desire_. Return to town via logout or Portal, then take the _Waypoint_ to the Crystal Veins.
