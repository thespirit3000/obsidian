22. Grab the _Waypoint_.
23. _(Optional)_: Return to town and speak with Helena to receive _Greust’s Necklace_. This quest only rewards an amulet but usually does not take more than a minute or so in total time, so it is your choice on a league starter whether to complete it. If you encounter the _Azmeri Shrine_ in the Northern Forest, place the necklace there and speak with Helena when you are next in town turning in other quests.

    - Enter the Den of Despair and kill Gruthkul, then return to the Dread Thicket.

31. Locate Yeena. The Vaal City is a massive, sprawling, and confusing zone for some players. There is always a part of the zone that is surrounded by dead ends, and is difficult to penetrate into (the “center” of the city, but not of the area itself). Yeena and the _Waypoint_ are always found here.
